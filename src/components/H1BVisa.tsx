        </div>
          <p>The most important factors reviewed by the USCIS are:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>a bachelor's or higher degree in a specific field is the entry-level requirement;</li>
            <li>the degree requirement is accepted throughout the industry in parallel positions among similar companies;</li>
            <li>absent such acceptance, the employer can show that the particular position is so complex or unique that a degree is required;</li>
            <li>the employer's normal requirement for the position is a degree (that is, other persons filling parallel positions hold degrees or the prior occupants of the position held degrees);</li>
            <li>the complexity of the specific job duties is usually associated with attainment of a degree; and</li>
            <li>the level of responsibility and authority involved in the position is usually associated with professional standing.</li>

        </div>
          <p>The USCIS has increasingly relied on the size factor in determining whether a position qualifies as a specialty occupation. In view of this trend, small employers will need to present a particularly strong case that it needs a specialty occupation worker, such as by demonstrating a prestigious client list or concrete plans to attract such clients.</p>

          <p>Under the USCIS rules, a foreign worker is considered qualified to perform services in a specialty occupation if he/she:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>holds a U.S. bachelor's or higher degree required to enter the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university;</li>

            <li>holds an unrestricted state license, registration, or certification that authorizes him/her fully to practice the occupation and be immediately engaged in that occupation in the state of intended employment; or</li>
            <li>has education, specialized training, and experience that is equivalent to training acquired by the attainment of a U.S. bachelor's or higher degree in the field.</li>

        </div>
          <p>Yes, the immigration rules require that a foreign worker be immediately able to fulfill the duties of his/her specialty occupation with respect to any applicable state licensing requirement for professionals in the field. Normally a permanent license must be obtained in order for a person employed in a field in which a license is required to qualify for H-1B status. However, in some instances, a state will permit a professional to fully practice his/her profession with a temporary license and such licenses will be accepted by USCIS.</p>

          <p>Before a petition can be filed with USCIS to qualify the foreign worker as a person engaged in a specialty occupation for H-1B purposes, the employer must first file a labor condition application with the DOL, in which it must make several required attestations. After the Department of Labor certifies the LCA, the employer will apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for approval to employ a foreign worker under H-1B status so that alien workers may be hired.</p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 pt-[5px] flex items-center mb-2">What must an employer do before filing an LCA (Labor Condition Application)?</h2>
        </div>
          <p>There are two things an employer must do before filing an LCA:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>First, the employer completes preliminary actions prior to filing an application with the DOL. It must determine the prevailing wage for the position using one of the following:
              <ul className="list-square ml-6">
                <li>Requesting that a National Prevailing Wage and Helpdesk Center (NPWHC) determination of prevailing wage determination be made (on or after January 1, 2010).</li>
                <li>Using a rate set forth in a collective bargaining agreement;</li>
                <li>Using a determination for the occupation and area issued under the Davis-Bacon Act (DBA);</li>
                <li>Using a determination for the occupation and area issued under the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act (SCA);</li>
                <li>Using a survey conducted by an independent authoritative source; or</li>
                <li>Using another legitimate source of information including the OFLC Online Data Center.</li>
              </ul>
              DOL rules state that “the employer is not required to use any specific methodology to determine the prevailing wage.“ The rules state, however, that if a collective bargaining agreement between a union and the employer exists that contains a wage rate applicable to the occupation, that rate must be considered the prevailing wage.
            </li>
            <li>The employer must also inform U.S. workers of the intent to hire a foreign worker by posting the completed LCA Form ETA 9035E, for the position. The posting must occur within the 30-day period preceding the date that the labor condition application is submitted to the DOL. Posting may occur in one of two methods: hard copy or electronic notice. The hard copy notice must be given to the bargaining representative for workers in the occupation or, if there is no bargaining representative, be posted for 10 consecutive days in at least two conspicuous locations at each place of employment where any H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 nonimmigrant will be employed. Distribution can be by whatever means the employer normally communicates with its employees including electronic postings (e.g., e-mail, bulletin board, and home web page). A copy of the LCA must also be provided to each nonimmigrant worker working pursuant to that LCA.</li>
          </ol>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 pt-[5px] flex items-center mb-2">How long is a prevailing wage determination valid?</h2>
        </div>
          <p>A prevailing wage determination will be valid for filing a period of ninety days to one year after issuance by the National Prevailing Wage and Helpdesk Center (NPWHC). The employer must file its LCA within the validity period specified on the form. The employer has the option of requesting a redetermination by submitting supplemental documentation, for example, an alternative wage source. The employer may also challenge the prevailing wage determination by requesting review by the NPWHC director.</p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 pt-[5px] flex items-center mb-2">Can a prevailing wage determination be reviewed?</h2>
        </div>
          <p>Yes, an employer may request review of a PWD (or a redetermination) within ten days of the date of issuance. An employer may also request BALCA review of the NPWHC's decision within thirty calendar days of the date of the decision.</p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 pt-[5px] flex items-center mb-2">May an employer ignore the prevailing wage determination and uses one of other methods of determining wages?</h2>
        </div>
          <p>Yes. Under current DOL policy the employer can choose to ignore completely the NPWHC determination if it disagrees with that determination and to use one of the other methods for establishing the prevailing wage.</p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 pt-[5px] flex items-center mb-2">What are the restrictions of an “independent authoritative source“?</h2>
        </div>
          <p>The DOL rules define an independent authoritative source as a “professional, business, trade, educational, or governmental association, organization, or other similar entity“ that has a recognized expertise in an occupational field.</p>
          <p>Use of independent authoritative sources must also conform to the criteria set forth in the LCA rules and November 2009 prevailing wage guidance. In the event of an investigation, the employer will need to justify its use of the alternative wage source under these standards.</p>

        </div>
          <p>An H-1B dependent employer is, generally, one whose H-1B workers comprise 15 percent or more of the employer's total workforce. Different thresholds apply to smaller employers. H-1B dependent employers who wish to hire only H-1B workers who are paid at least $60,000 per year or have a master's degree or higher in a specialty related to the employment, can be exempted from these additional rules.</p>
          <p>H-1B dependent employers and willful violator employers must attest to the following three elements addressing non-displacement and recruitment of U.S. workers:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>The employer will not displace any similarly employed U.S. worker within 90 days before or after applying for H-1B status, or an extension of status for any H-1B worker;</li>
            <li>The employer will not place any H-1B worker employed pursuant to the LCA at the worksite of another employer unless the employer first makes a bona fide inquiry as to whether the other employer has displaced or intends to displace a similarly employed U.S. worker within 90 days before or after the placement of the H-1B worker; and</li>
            <li>The employer, before applying for H-1B status for any foreign worker pursuant to an H-1B LCA, took good faith steps to recruit U.S. workers for the job for which the foreign worker is sought, at wages at least equal to those offered to the H-1B worker. Also, the employer will offer the job to any U.S. worker who applies and is equally or better qualified than the H-1B worker. This attestation does not apply if the H-1B worker is a “priority worker“</li>

        </div>
          <p>Each employer seeking an H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 nonimmigrant has several responsibilities:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>The employer shall submit a completed Labor Condition Application (LCA) on Form ETA 9035E or Form ETA 9035 (if special permission is granted) in the manner prescribed by the regulations. By completing and signing the LCA, the employer agrees to several attestations regarding an employer's responsibilities, including the wages and benefits and working conditions provided to US workers and the nonimmigrant workers.</li>
            <li>The employer shall make the LCA and necessary supporting documentation available for public examination at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. and/or the place of employment within one working day after the date on which the LCA is filed with ETA.</li>
            <li>The employer may submit a copy of the approved LCA to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) with a completed petition (USCIS Form I-129) requesting H-1B or H-1B1 classification. For the E-3 visa, employers may or may not need to submit a petition to USCIS. Instead, foreign workers: (1) may apply for approval directly with a U.S. consulate; (2) pay a visa fee; and (3) are issued an I-94 entry/exit document at port of entry, to function as their work authorization.</li>
            <li>The employer shall not allow the nonimmigrant worker to begin work until USCIS grants the worker authorization to work in the U.S. for that employer or, in the case of a nonimmigrant who is already in H-1B status and is changing employment, to another employer until the new employer files a petition supported by a certified LCA.</li>
            <li>The employer shall maintain documentation to meet its burden of proof with respect to the validity of the statements made in its LCA and the accuracy of information provided, in the event that such statement or information is challenged. The employer shall also maintain such documentation at its principal place of business in the U.S. and shall make such documentation available to DOL for inspection and copying upon request.</li>

        </div>
          <p>The H-1B regulations currently require that a United States employer establish that it has an employer-employee relation with respect to the beneficiary, as indicated by the fact that it may hire, pay, fire, supervise or otherwise control the work of any such employee. In addition to demonstrating that a valid employer-employee relationship will exist between the petitioner and the beneficiary, the petitioner must continue to comply with all of the requirements for an H-1B petition including:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>establishing that the beneficiary is coming to the United States temporarily to work in a specialty occupation;</li>
            <li>demonstrating that the beneficiary is qualified to perform services in the specialty occupation; and</li>
            <li>filing of a Labor Condition Application (LCA) specific to each location where the beneficiary will perform services.</li>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 pt-[5px] flex items-center mb-2">What factors does USCIS consider when evaluating the employer-employee relationship?</h2>
        </div>
          <p>USCIS will evaluate whether the petitioner has the “right to control“ the beneficiary's employment, such as when, where and how the beneficiary performs the job. Factors to be considered include the manner and extent to which the petitioner actually supervises the beneficiary; the petitioner's right to control the beneficiary's daily work and work product; and the petitioner's right to hire, pay, and fire the beneficiary. Adjudicators will review the totality of the circumstances when making a determination as to whether the employer-employee relationship exists.</p>

        </div>
          <p>Petitioners will need to provide detailed documentation of the employment relationship. Particularly in cases in which the beneficiary will be assigned to third-party (client) worksites, employers will need to carefully document that it, and not the client, will have the right to supervise, direct, and review the foreign national's work and terminate his or her employment. A detailed itinerary providing information on the multiple work locations will also need to be attached.</p>

        </div>
          <p>The documents listed in the memorandum are only examples of evidence that establish the petitioner's right to control the beneficiary's employment. Unless a document is required by the regulations, i.e. an itinerary, a petitioner may provide similarly probative documents. A petitioner may submit a combination of any documents that sufficiently establish that the required relationship between the petitioner and the beneficiary exists. A petitioner should explain how the documents the petitioner is providing establish the relationship. Adjudicators will review and weigh all the evidence submitted to determine whether a qualifying employer-employee relationship has been established.</p>

          <p>H-1B workers are granted the following:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>The employer must give the worker a copy of the LCA.</li>
            <li>The employer must pay the worker at least the same wage rate as paid to other employees with similar experience and qualifications or the local prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of employment, whichever is higher.</li>
            <li>The employer must pay for non-productive time caused by the employer or by the worker's lack of a license or permit.</li>
            <li>The employer must offer the worker fringe benefits on the same basis as its other employees.</li>
            <li>The employer may not require the worker to pay a penalty for leaving employment prior to any agreed date. However, this restriction does not preclude the employer from seeking “liquidated damages“ pursuant to relevant state law. Liquidated damages are generally estimates stated in a contract of the anticipated damages to the employer caused by the worker's breach of contract.</li>

        </div>
          <p>Generally not. An H-1B alien can be the beneficiary of a labor certification application, an immigrant visa petition, adjustment of status application, or take other steps toward Lawful Permanent Resident status without affecting H-1B status. U.S. immigration law allows for dual intent for those in H-1B status. This means that a person may remain in nonimmigrant H-1B status, even though the person intends to become a permanent resident. While the application for permanent residency is pending, you may continue to travel and work in H-1B visa status.</p>
