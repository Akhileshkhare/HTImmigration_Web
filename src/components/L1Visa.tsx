            What is the purpose of L-1 Visa?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The L-1 visa is one of the most useful nonimmigrant visas available
            to employees of foreign companies. The purpose of the L-1 visa is to
            facilitate the transfer of key employees to the United States from
            companies that are affiliated with or related to United States
            corporations. Nationals of all countries are eligible, provided the
            specific qualifications for the visa are satisfied.

            Is the L-1 visa holder allowed to have dual intent?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Yes. Like the H-1B, the L-1 visa does not preclude the person from
            seeking lawful permanent residence while pursuing or being present in
            the United Sates on an L-1 visa.

            Who needs to file L visa? What should be filed to obtain an L visa?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A U.S. employer seeking to transfer a qualifying employee of the
            same organization to the United States must first obtain USCIS
            permission to do so, by filing a petition to classify nonimmigrant as
            temporary worker, Form I-129 and a special L supplement to the form,
            with the USCIS.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Where should I-129 Forms be filed?</h3>
          <p>
            I-129 forms should be filed with either the Vermont Service Center or
            the California Service Center, depending on the location of
            employment. When the foreign national will be employed in multiple
            locations, the state in which the employer is located will determine
            whether the I-129 form is filed with the VSC or CSC.

            How long can I stay in the United States if I have the L-1 Visa?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The L-1A visa has duration up to seven years for managers and
            executives and L-1B up to five years for persons of specialized
            knowledge. The duration of stay is issued for an initial period of
            three years and may be extended for additional periods. In the case
            of a new office, the visa is issued for one year and extensions are
            possible.

          <p>
            Extensions are sought on Form I-129 and L supplements; this form
            encompasses both the petition extension and the foreign national's
            extension of stay. Form I-539 must be used for the extension of stay
            of family members and must be filed concurrently with the petition
            extension request.

            How long must the foreign worker have been employed by the overseas
            company?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The employee who is to be transferred must have been continuously
            employed by the overseas company for a period of at least one year
            out of the last three years prior to entry to the United States.
            Short business or pleasure trips to the United States during the one
            year period will not disqualify the employee from the visa;
            however, extended trips or visits to the United States may be
            considered by the USCIS as an interruption of the one-year foreign
            employment requirement.

            The prior employer/foreign company must be related to the U.S.
            company, either as a subsidiary, affiliate or division. In most
            cases, the relationship must be documented to the USCIS.
            Partnerships and even sole proprietorships can serve as qualifying
            companies for L-1 visa purposes, but must establish a separate
            business and economic identity.

          <p>
            The petitioning company of an L-visa must continue to be a qualifying
            organization. The foreign company must continue as a viable business
            entity throughout the employment period of the L-1 visa holder. If
            the foreign entity ceases to exist or ceases to function as a viable
            business entity, then the L-visa of the employee is jeopardized.
