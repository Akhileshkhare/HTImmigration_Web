            What is the purpose of J-1 visa?
          </h3>
          <p>
            J-1 visa is for a person coming to the United States as a student,
            researcher, professor, nonacademic specialist, physician, international
            visitor, camp counselor, au pair, or summer student in a travel/work
            program.

            What is the period of stay of J (J-1 and J-2) visa?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The initial admission of an exchange visitor, spouse, and children may
            not exceed the period specified on Form DS-2019, plus a period of 30
            days for travel or as designated by USCIS. J-1 exchange visitors are
            admitted for “duration of status” to complete the programs reflected
            on Form DS-2019 and are not given a date certain on their I-94
            Arrival/Departure record.

            What is foreign residency requirement? How does it influence a J visa
            holder?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Some J-1 holders are subject to a foreign residency requirement and
            must leave the United States after their visa expires. J-1 nonimmigrants
            subject to this requirement are not eligible to change status within
            the U.S. (except to A or G), nor to obtain H, L, or K visas, or adjust
            status to permanent residence, unless they receive a waiver.

          <p>
            Yes, except for H, L, or K. J-1 nonimmigrants subject to the foreign
            residence requirement may obtain other nonimmigrant visas at a U.S.
            Consulate abroad, if eligible.

            When might a government agency request a J waiver on behalf of an
            exchange visitor?
          </h3>
          <p>
            If a U.S. government agency thinks that required departure of the
            exchange visitor would be detrimental to a program or activity of
            interest to the agency, it might request a waiver on behalf of the
            exchange visitor.

            Does the exchange visitor have to be employed in a government agency to
            obtain an “agency request” J-waiver?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No. The exchange visitor can be employed by either a private employer or
            a government agency. Private or government employers sponsor a waiver to
            a government agency, which decides if a waiver is appropriate.

            What is the procedure of a government “agency request” J-waiver?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The employer sponsors a waiver and applies to a government agency. If
            the agency deems it appropriate, the waiver request is sent to the DOS
            for evaluation. USCIS makes the final determination after DOS
            recommendation.

            What kind of sponsorship may a J-1 physician obtain for the purpose of
            J Waiver?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Agencies have special guidelines for J-1 physicians, including
            employer-employee relationships (e.g., Veterans Administration),
            academic research (e.g., Department of Health and Human Services), or
            commitment to work in medically underserved areas (e.g., Appalachian
            Regional Commission, USDA).

          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">
            What constitutes “exceptional hardship” for the purpose of J waiver?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Unforeseeable hardship, not just normal hardship, must be demonstrated.
            Examples include serious medical problems, possible persecution of family
            members, or economic reasons if the family cannot support itself abroad.

            Is separation of a U.S. citizen spouse from the J-1 holder “exceptional
            hardship”?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Probably not. Normal separation or hardship from living abroad is not
            considered exceptional. However, economic hardship or the presence of
            U.S. citizen children may enhance the hardship showing.

            How can an exchange visitor be granted with J Waiver by obtaining a
            “no objection” letter?
          </h3>
          <p>
            If the skill area is on the home country’s skills list or the visitor
            received home government funding, a no objection statement from the home
            country usually results in a waiver. If U.S. government funding is
            involved, it is difficult to obtain this type of waiver.

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What is the procedure of applying for J Waiver?</h3>
          <p>
            Applicants must file Form DS-3035 online, print the barcode page, and
            submit it with the fee and documents to the Waiver Review Division. Some
            documents must be sent directly by the embassy or government agency. DOS
            forwards its recommendation to USCIS, which makes the final decision.

            application?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A statement from the home country must be sent to DOS through official
            channels. Most embassies and consulates are familiar with this process.

            File Form I-612 with USCIS, including evidence supporting hardship or

            the file to DOS for recommendation.

          <p>
            Consult your responsible program officer. If your program was funded by
            the U.S. Government, your government, or an international organization
            funded by either, you are subject to the two-year home-country physical

          <p>
            No. Waiver recommendation applications are thoroughly considered and
            cannot be appealed. You may reapply using another basis if applicable.
            The only exception is if you have new information for a persecution or
            hardship waiver, in which case you may reapply to USCIS.

            Division?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Applications are denied when the reasons for requesting the waiver do not
            outweigh the program and foreign policy considerations. Waivers for those
            who received U.S. Government funding are generally denied.

          </h3>
          <p>
            With one exception, a denied application cannot be reconsidered or
            appealed. The exception is for new information in persecution or hardship
            waivers, in which case you may reapply to USCIS with a new application
            and fee.
