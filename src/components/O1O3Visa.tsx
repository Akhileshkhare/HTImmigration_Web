      <div className="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What is the purpose of O-1 visa?</h3>
          <p>O-1 visa benefits aliens of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics. The O-3 visa is for dependents (spouse and children) of O-1 visa holders.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Compared to H-1B, what are the benefits of O-1?</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
            <li>No visa lottery that the employee needs to go through. O-1 petitions do not have the lottery restriction, even for private companies.</li>
            <li>There is no wage requirement for O-1. However, the salary should be appropriate for a position of O-1 caliber.</li>
            <li>Premium processing is always available for O-1.</li>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What is the standard of review of O-1 visa?</h3>
          <p>Aliens of different specialties are imposed different standards of review. For science, education, and business, extraordinary ability is shown by sustained national or international acclaim and the alien must have risen to the top of the field. For the arts, the standard is "distinction"—a high level of achievement and recognition. For television or motion picture industry, a record of extraordinary achievement is required. All O-1 seekers must be entering the U.S. to work in the field in which they have received acclaim.</p>

          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Who qualifies as an alien of extraordinary ability as scientists, educators, business people and athletes?</h3>
          <p>Foreign nationals must have sustained national or international acclaim and their achievements recognized in the field through extensive documentation. They must seek to enter the U.S. to continue to work in the field of their acclaim.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What does “extraordinary ability” mean?</h3>
          <p>“Extraordinary ability” means a level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of that small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">How should an application establish that the foreign national has sustained national or international acclaim in business, science and education?</h3>
          <p>National or international acclaim can be demonstrated by a major internationally recognized award (e.g., Nobel Prize) or at least three of the following:</p>
          <ul className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>Receipt of nationally/internationally recognized prizes/awards for excellence in the field</li>
            <li>Membership in associations in the field that require outstanding achievement</li>
            <li>Published material in professional or major trade publications or major media about the alien</li>
            <li>Participation as a judge of the work of others</li>
            <li>Original contributions of major significance</li>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">May the O-1 visa holder have dual intent?</h3>
          <p>No, O-1 is not a dual-intent visa. However, there is no foreign residence requirement for O-1 beneficiaries. Filing I-140 or I-485 alone should not prohibit one from obtaining O-1, but after filing I-485, one should not travel internationally on O-1 until receiving Advance Parole.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Who can file the O petition?</h3>

For consular processing, after I-129 approval, you must schedule an interview at a U.S. consulate, receive your O-1 visa, and enter the U.S. to activate O-1 status. Administrative processing may delay issuance.</p>
