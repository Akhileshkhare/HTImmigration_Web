        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What is the purpose of E-1/E-2 visas?</h3>
          <p>E-1 visas are available to Treaty Traders, while E-2 visas are available to Treaty Investors. Both require that the U.S. maintain treaties of commerce and navigation with the foreign country, allowing for trade and/or investment in the U.S.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What are the requirements of E-1 “treaty trader” visa?</h3>
          <ul className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>The applicant must be a national of a treaty country.</li>
            <li>The trading firm must have the nationality of the treaty country.</li>
            <li>The international trade must be “substantial” (sizable and continuing volume).</li>
            <li>Trade must be principally between the U.S. and the treaty country (more than 50%).</li>
            <li>Trade means the international exchange of goods, services, and technology.</li>
            <li>The applicant must be employed in a supervisory/executive capacity or possess highly specialized skills essential to the firm.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What is “trade” for the purpose of treaty trader visa?</h3>
          <p>“Trade” includes the exchange, purchase, or sale of goods and/or services. It is interpreted broadly and can include banking, tourism, transportation, communication, consulting, design, engineering, and insurance.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What constitutes “substantial” for the purpose of E visa?</h3>
          <p>For traders, “substantial” means more than 50% of the activity. For investors, it is an amount sufficient to establish a viable, non-marginal enterprise. Trade transactions do not have to be individually large, but must be numerous and total at least 51% between the U.S. and the treaty country.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What are the requirements of E-2 Treaty Investor visa?</h3>
          <ul className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>The applicant must be a national of a treaty country.</li>
            <li>The business must possess the nationality of the treaty country.</li>
            <li>The applicant must have invested or be actively investing.</li>
            <li>The enterprise must be real and operating.</li>
            <li>The investment must be substantial.</li>
            <li>Investment must be more than marginal (not solely for earning a living).</li>
            <li>The applicant must be in a position to develop and direct the enterprise.</li>
            <li>If an employee, must be destined to an executive/supervisory position or possess essential skills.</li>
            <li>Must intend to depart the U.S. when E-2 status terminates.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What qualifies a company as a national of a treaty country?</h3>
          <p>The investment enterprise must be at least 50%-owned by nationals of the treaty country, and the investor or employee must also be a national of that country.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What is the “substantial” requirement of investment for the E-2 visa?</h3>
          <ul className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>Substantial in proportion to the total cost of the enterprise.</li>
            <li>Sufficient to ensure the investor’s financial commitment to the operation.</li>
            <li>Of a magnitude to support the likelihood of successful development and direction.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The lower the total cost, the higher the proportion of investment required. Generally, $100,000 is a rule-of-thumb minimum, but less may be accepted if it represents all or almost all of the business cost. $1,000,000 or more is presumed substantial.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Are there restrictions on the investment for the E-2 visa?</h3>
          <p>The investment must be active, not passive. It must involve funds/assets for which the investor is personally at risk. Loans secured by the assets of the enterprise are not acceptable.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">How long can I stay in the U.S. with the E-visa?</h3>
          <p>Treaty aliens are admitted for an initial period of two years. On every trip abroad, a treaty alien is readmitted for a new two-year period. If you do not travel, you must apply for an extension with USCIS (Form I-129 for principal, I-539 for dependents). Extensions are granted in two-year increments, with no outer limit.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Does my E-visa authorize me to work?</h3>
          <p>The E-visa holder may engage in employment activities incidental to the terms and conditions of the classification. Terms and limitations will be annotated on the visa.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Does my spouse’s E-visa authorize him/her to work?</h3>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Where should the E visa application be submitted? What forms should be filed?</h3>
          <p>Apply for an E visa at a U.S. consulate abroad using Form DS-156E and supporting documentation. For those already in the U.S., apply for a change of status to E-1 or E-2 with USCIS Form I-129 and the same documentation.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">Can I expedite my E visa petition?</h3>

        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">How long is the E-visa valid?</h3>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-lg">What visa does family member of E-1 and E-2 visa get?</h3>
