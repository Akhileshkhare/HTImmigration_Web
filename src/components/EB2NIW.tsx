          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0097b2] mt-8 mb-2">Introduction</h2>
          <p className="text-[21px] text-gray-700 mb-2">A petition for an employment-based immigrant visa under the second preference ("EB-2"), unlike the first preference category for individuals with extraordinary ability ("EB-1A"), generally requires a specific, permanent job offer and a corresponding approved labor certification. However, under the “National Interest Waiver” (NIW) provision for EB-2, an individual may seek a waiver of the otherwise required offer of employment – and thus corresponding labor certification – by establishing that his/her admission to permanent residency would be in the so-called "national interest." As a result, the potential beneficiaries can petition on their own behalf. The NIW requires more than a regular EB-2 petition, and the procedure is to file the Form I-140 together with corresponding evidence to establish that the foreign person's admission to the United States for permanent residency would be in the national interest.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0097b2] mt-8 mb-2">Our Success with NIW Petitions</h2>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0097b2] mt-8 mb-2">Still Need to be Qualified for EB-2 Category</h2>
          <p className="text-[21px] text-gray-700 mb-2">A successful national interest argument does not establish eligibility for second preference classification. The National Interest Waiver (NIW) waives a labor certification and the necessity of having an offer of employment, but it does not waive the basic "entry" requirements for second preference classification. Only after the second preference threshold is satisfied can a National Interest Waiver (NIW) be considered. <a href="https://www.wegreened.com/niw/EB2-Employment-Based-2nd-Preference" className="text-[#0097b2] underline">See the requirements of EB-2</a>.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0097b2] mt-8 mb-2">What is "National Interest"?</h2>
          <p className="text-[21px] text-gray-700 mb-2">The Immigration Act of 1990 states that the standards for a national interest waiver under the EB-2 category are "significantly above that necessary to prove prospective national benefit". The law does not indicate specifically what counts for National Interest. USCIS leaves the application of this test as flexible as possible. The burden of proof rests with the foreign national to establish that exemption from or waiver of the job offer will be in the national interest. Each case is judged on its own merits. Factors considered include: improving the U.S. economy, improving wages and working conditions, providing affordable housing, improving the U.S. environment, and requests by U.S. government agencies.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0097b2] mt-8 mb-2">Matter of Dhanasar: The Current NIW Standard</h2>
          <p className="text-[21px] text-gray-700 mb-2">On December 27, 2016, the AAO issued a new decision (Matter of Dhanasar) establishing a new analytical framework for NIW eligibility. The three prongs are:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-8 text-[21px] text-gray-700 mb-2">
            <li>The foreign national’s proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance;</li>
            <li>The foreign national is well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor;</li>
            <li>On balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the job offer and labor certification requirements.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0097b2] mt-8 mb-2">How to Meet the Requirements for NIW</h2>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0097b2] mt-6 mb-2">A. Substantial Merit and National Importance</h3>
          <p className="text-[21px] text-gray-700 mb-2">The endeavor’s merit may be demonstrated in business, science, technology, culture, health, or education. Evidence includes a detailed description of the proposed endeavor, documentary evidence, and letters of recommendation from experts in the field. National importance is shown by the endeavor’s potential impact, including national or global implications, economic effects, societal welfare, or government recognition.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0097b2] mt-6 mb-2">B. Well-Positioned to Advance the Proposed Endeavor</h3>
          <p className="text-[21px] text-gray-700 mb-2">The foreign national must demonstrate education, skills, knowledge, and a record of success. Evidence includes expert letters, documentation of significant roles in funded projects, education background, skills, expertise, memberships, awards, media reports, patents, and more.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0097b2] mt-6 mb-2">C. Balance Test to Show National Interest</h3>
          <p className="text-[21px] text-gray-700 mb-2">USCIS evaluates whether, on balance, it would be beneficial to the U.S. to waive the job offer and labor certification requirements. Factors include the petitioner’s qualifications, the impracticality of obtaining a job offer or labor certification, urgency of the work, potential job creation, and self-employment.</p>
