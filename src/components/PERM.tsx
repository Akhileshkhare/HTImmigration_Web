        Labor Certification
      </h2>
      <p>
        Foreign persons who have been offered permanent employment in the U.S.,
        and who do not meet the criteria for exemption from labor certification,
        must obtain Alien Employment Certification, commonly referred to as
        labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The DOL
        must be satisfied that there are no qualified U.S. workers available to
        fill the permanent job offered to the foreign person, and that the
        working conditions and wages offered for the position will not have
        adverse effect on the U.S. labor market. Once the labor certification is
        approved, it serves as the basis for filing an employment based second
        or third preference petition with the USCIS.

        Certification
      </h2>
      <p>
        To obtain labor certification, the employer must demonstrate that he or
        she has followed a precise program of recruitment that tests the local
        labor market for qualified and available U.S. workers in the geographic
        area where the job will be filled. The employer has to prove to the DOL
        that:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
        <li>
          The job being offered to the foreign person is available and is
          otherwise open to persons in the United States
        </li>
        <li>There are no unreasonable or unnecessary conditions placed on the position and</li>
        <li>The wage offered is at least the prevailing wage in the community.</li>

        <i className="fa fa-puzzle-piece" /> Reduction in Recruitment
      </h2>
      <p>
        In certain cases, it may be possible to avoid the labor certification
        process by proving to the DOL that the employer has, during the period
        of at least six months, attempted to fill the position through normal
        and customary efforts and has failed to find qualified workers.

          What is the Effect of Reduction in Recruitment during PERM process?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If the employer has, during the period of at least six months,
          attempted to fill the position through normal and customary efforts
          but has failed to find qualified workers, it may be possible to avoid
          the labor certification process. Under these circumstances, it may be
          possible to have the DOL agree that there is no need for a labor
          certification application since the employer has made reasonable and
          good faith efforts to fill the position. If the employer can document
          these good faith efforts over a sustained period of time, it will
          request permission for a Reduction in Recruitment certification that
          will accept the employer's efforts as dispositive of the labor market
          test. This will shorten the processing time for labor certification
          and this seems to be the wave of the future because of budgetary
          considerations.

      </h2>
      <p>
        DOL has taken some measures to protect U.S. workers: (1) No Tailoring the
        job; (2) No unreasonable conditions; (3) Prevailing wage requirement;
        (4) Can't hire a foreign person just because he/she is more qualified;
        (5) Extra documentation for recent layoff.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-2">
          DOL Measures to Protect U.S. Workers
        </h3>
        <p>
          DOL has several policies to protect U.S. workers in the process of
          applying labor certification.
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold mb-0">A. No Tailoring the Job:</p>
        <p>
          The DOL will be careful to ensure that the U.S. employer does not
          tailor the job requirements to a foreign person's particular experience.
          A U.S. employer must justify any unusual job requirement based on a
          business necessity, not just a personal preference.
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold mb-0">B. No Unreasonable Conditions:</p>
        <p>
          The DOL will deny the labor certification if the employer requires
          special conditions that only a foreign person can or is willing to
          fulfill, unless those conditions are essential to the business.
          Therefore, in the United States, a job requirement that a person must
          speak a particular foreign language is considered prima facie
          unreasonable and can only be overcome by proof that knowledge of a
          foreign language is essential to the proper performance of the job.
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold mb-0">C. Prevailing Wage Requirement:</p>
        <p>
          A U.S. employer must offer the job to U.S. workers at the prevailing
          wage for the job. The prevailing wage is based on the geographic area
          of employment and on the job duties and requirements. The DOL in the
          state of intended employment determines the prevailing wage. If a U.S.
          employer disagrees with the prevailing wage set by the DOL, he or she
          can submit evidence, such as an independent survey, to challenge the
          DOL prevailing wage determination.
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold mb-0">D. Can't Hire Foreign Persons Merely Because They Are More Qualified:</p>
        <p>
          The U.S. employer does not have the right to offer the job (on the
          basis of a labor certification) to the foreign person simply because
          the U.S. worker is not equally skilled. A U.S. worker who does not meet
          all of the requirements of the job cannot be rejected, if that U.S.
          worker could receive job training or he or she is able to perform the
          job duties in a normally acceptable manner given his or her background.
          The U.S. employer can only offer the job to the foreign person if the
          U.S. worker candidate does not meet the minimum qualifications for the
          job. The DOL establishes these minimum qualifications and they are all
          listed in a publication entitled The Dictionary of Occupational Titles.
          (DOT).
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold mb-0">E. Extra Documentation for Recent Layoff:</p>
        <p>
          If there was layoff within six months prior to the filing of the
          application for labor certification, the employer must attest to and
          document notification and consideration of U.S. workers who were laid
          off and who worked in the same occupation or a related occupation to
          the one for which certification is being sought.

        In 2004, DOL issued final regulations that established a new labor
        certification procedure, termed “Program Electronic Review Management“
        (PERM). PERM took effect in March 28, 2005, with intent to facilitate
        faster determinations. Also, more measures are being designed to protect
        U.S. workers under PERM.

        <p className="font-semibold mb-0">A. Register Online:</p>
        <p>
          Employers must register through the PERM online system to file

          Form 9089--the Application for Permanent Employment Certification.
          Labor certification application is encouraged to file electronically.
          The application can not be submitted more than 180 after the first
          recruitment step listed on the form. In Form ETA 9089, the employer has
          to describe the job in detail, indicate minimum education and
          experience and any special requirements.

        the DOL computer system will then review the application based upon
        various selection criteria that will allow problematic applications to be
        pulled from the system for an audit. The DOL has indicated that it has
        incorporated identifiers into the processing system that will be used to
        select cases for audit based upon program requirements. In addition, the
        computer system will also randomly select some applications for audit.

          There are several reasons why a particular case is selected for audit.

          be issued. The agency targets for audit application that appear to have
          problematic issues, for example, applications listing foreign language

        Denial or Supervised Recruitment
      </h2>
      <p>
        If the DOL determines that the documentation submitted by the employer in
        response to the audit letter is complete and consistent with responses on
        Form 9089, it will certify the application. If the documentation is deemed
        deficient to the DOL, the certification may be denied. There are three
        results after audit: application approved, application denied or supervise
        recruitment.

          What Happens if the PERM Application is Denied or Ordered Supervised
          Recruitment after Audit?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <b>Denial</b>: If, after reviewing the employer audit file, the DOL
          issue an denial of the application, PERM provides that the employer may
          file a request for reconsideration within 30 days from the date of
          issuance of the denial. Otherwise, A denial may be appealed to the Board
          of Alien Labor certification Appeals. (BALCA). In addition, under the
          final PERM rule, there is no waiting period imposed on employers after a
          denial of certification. A new labor certification involving the same
          individual and the identical job opportunity may be filed at any time
          unless a request for review by BALCA (Board of Alien Labor Certification
          Appeals) is pending.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Supervised Recruitment</b>: Alternatively, the certifying offer may
          request additional documentation or order supervised recruitment. When
          supervised recruitment is ordered, all previous recruitment carried out
          before the employer filed its PERM application is disregarded, and an
          entirely new recruitment campaigns is begun under the direction of the
          certifying officer.
        </p>
        <p>
          (NOTE) Supervised Recruitment may be ordered without audit, especially
          in industries and geographical areas where large-scale layoffs have
          occurred. An order may be issued for future filing in certain instances.

        <i className="fa fa-file-text-o" /> Effect of Labor Certification
      </h2>
      <p>
        Once the case is certified by the Labor Department, the applicant's
        employer can file an I-140 petition with the USCIS. The labor certification
        is not an authorization of any kind, and only serves the limited purpose
        of establishing that there are insufficient available, qualified and
        willing U.S. workers to fill the position and that the noncitizen's
        employment will not have an adverse effect on the wages and working
        conditions of similarly situated U.S. workers. The certification once
        issued, is valid indefinitely as long as the job remains available.

      <p>
        DOL policy bars amendment of the approved labor certification. Once an

        typographical errors as well.

      </h2>
      <p>
        If changes occur in the facts surrounding the certification, it is the
        role of the USCIS to evaluate those changes to decide whether they affect
        the validity of the certification. If not, no changes to the certification
        are needed. If the changes do affect the validity of the certification,
        USCIS will deny the preference petition.

        Most of the changes requiring evaluation by the USCIS of the continuing

        <li>
          The location of the job opportunity has changed, either because the

          different work site of the employer.

        Current Trends of PERM Application
      </h2>
      <p>
        While the conditions of the local job market will determine the
        possibility of obtaining labor certification, certain trends are apparent.

            Visas More Available for Skilled Workers
          </span>
          : As a matter of practical reality, immigrant visas are only available
          for persons whose jobs require a minimum of two years more training and
          experience in order to perform the job. This is caused by the backlog in
          the category of other workers for the third employment-based preference.
          It is so long that most job offers will not survive the long delay.

            Geographical Areas and Job Types are Important
          </span>
          : The job market will be affected by the number of jobs in the
          particular area. As an example, it may be very difficult to prove that
          there is a job shortage for hotel managers in a resort area because
          these jobs and geographical areas attract many qualified U.S. candidates.
          Generally, the U.S. economy and the law favor foreign persons who have
          particular job capabilities and skills that are not readily obtainable in
          the U.S. labor market.

            Jobs at Opposite Ends of Spectrum Have More Chance of Approval
          </span>
          : It is generally easier to obtain a labor certification for job skills
          that occupy the opposite ends of the spectrum. For example, a scientist
          who is experienced in advanced molecular biochemistry will probably
          receive a labor certification. Likewise, an attendant for a coin operated
          laundry at the prevailing wage may not be able to find willing U.S.
          workers to fill the position because of the low wage and unfavorable job
          conditions.
